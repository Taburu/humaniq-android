# What is Humaniq?

Humaniq is a new kind of mobile bank, unchained from the massive ledger most bitcoin users are required to keep. To create a wallet and use the system, Humaniq uses facial biometric recognition algorithms to create unique user signatures that are extremely secure and remove the need for passwords. Humaniq users can get a quick access to their balances and lets them transact with other users/merchants. Mobile Wallet manages private and public keys for the user which are used to sign transactions locally.
